inspired by this question and Aaron Hall's answer on Stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/449560/how-do-i-determine-the-size-of-an-object-in-python/30316760#30316760

Function(s) that attempts to get the whole size of objects, including objects they "contain" or point to.

This will include unittests of the function.
